# Comparing Template engines for Spring MVC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jreijn/spring-comparing-template-engines.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jreijn/spring-comparing-template-engines)

This is a demo project, which accompanied my ["Shoot-out! Template engines for the JVM"](http://www.slideshare.net/jreijn/comparing-templateenginesjvm) presentation, which shows the differences among several Java template engines in combination with Spring MVC. Template engines used in this project are:

## Benchmarking

In case you want to benchmark the different template engines I would recommend using Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool or Siege an HTTP/HTTPS stress tester.
You can try any of the following URLs.

    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/jsp
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/velocity
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/freemarker
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/thymeleaf
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/mustache
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/jade
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/pebble
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/handlebars
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/scalate
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/httl
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/chunk
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/htmlFlow
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/trimou
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/rocker
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/ickenham
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/rythm
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/groovy
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/liqp
    $ ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/kotlinx

For creating the below benchmark results I used ApacheBench (version 2.4.25) with the following settings:

```
ab -n 25000 -c 25 -k http://localhost:8080/jsp
```
With 25 concurrent requests and 25.000 requests in total this resulted in the following numbers:

*Keep in mind that in the real world, these results will differ depending on the complexity of the templates, hardware, etc, so it's just an indication and if you want to know the truth you will have to run the benchmark yourself to see how such a template engine performs in your specific environment.*

Chunk produces pages with variable length. I haven't investigated it yet. ab might fail, and for Chunk use:

    $ ab -n 25000 -c 25 -l http://localhost:8080/chunk

### How were the results measured?

Before the performance of each template engines was measured, there were at least 2 dry runs with the exact same settings, to make sure that initialization of the engines, warm up of the JVM and additional caches have taken place. There were at least 5 iterations of the same benchmark before calculating the average time it took.

### For Mac OS X users

Mac OS X has only 16K ports available that won't be released until socket
TIME_WAIT is passed. The default timeout for TIME_WAIT is 15 seconds.
Consider reducing in case of available port bottleneck.

You can check whether this is a problem with netstat:

    # sysctl net.inet.tcp.msl
    net.inet.tcp.msl: 15000

Now if you want to change this you can do so by doing:

    # sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=1000
    net.inet.tcp.msl: 15000 -> 1000

In case you still run into problem you might want to read [this thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216267/ab-program-freezes-after-lots-of-requests-why/1217100#1217100) on ephemeral ports.
